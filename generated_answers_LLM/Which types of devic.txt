Here is a step by step solution to find out which types of devices get the most ad clicks, ranked from highest to lowest.

Step 1: Import necessary libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Step 2: Load the dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data/dataset.csv')
```

Step 3: Filter out the rows where tag is 'fclick'

```python
df = df[df['tag'] == 'fclick']
```

Step 4: Count the number of clicks for each device type

```python
device_clicks = df['hardware'].value_counts()
```

Step 5: Sort the device types by the number of clicks in descending order

```python
device_clicks = device_clicks.sort_values(ascending=False)
```

Step 6: Print the device types ranked by the number of clicks

```python
print(device_clicks)
```

This code will print the types of devices ranked from the highest to the lowest number of ad clicks. The 'hardware' column in the dataset is assumed to represent the device type. If the device type is represented by a different column, replace 'hardware' with the appropriate column name.
