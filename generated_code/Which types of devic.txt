:
1. Read the dataset and filter rows where tag is 'fclick'. This will give us a list of all impressions that resulted in clicks.
2. For each row, extract information about device model and operating system.
3. Count the number of times each combination of device model and operating system appears in our filtered data set.
4. Sort this count by decreasing order to get the most clicked devices first.
5. Return the result as a list or string.

Let's start with step 1: Read the dataset and filter rows where tag is 'fclick'.

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Loading data from '../data/dataset.csv' into a DataFrame called df
filter_df = df[df['tag'] == 'fclick']
```

Step 2: For each row, extract information about device model and operating system.

```python
device_models = []
os_names = []
for index, row in filter_df.iterrows():
    device_models.append(row['model'])
    os_names.append
